Student Performance in Exams Using Machine Learning

This project, Student Performance in Exams Using Machine Learning, leverages machine learning techniques to predict student outcomes based on academic and socio-demographic factors. The research utilizes a dataset of 1,000 student records and evaluates six machine learning algorithmsâ€”Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Among these, SVM emerged as the most effective model, achieving 93% accuracy due to its ability to handle complex data relationships and minimize overfitting.

A user-friendly web interface was developed using Flask, enabling real-time grade predictions based on user inputs. The project underscores the potential of machine learning to address challenges in education, such as identifying at-risk students and improving resource allocation.

Future work could focus on expanding the dataset, incorporating additional features like attendance and extracurricular activities, and exploring advanced algorithms such as Neural Networks to enhance prediction accuracy further. This repository demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in educational analytics, offering a valuable tool for institutions seeking to optimize student performance.
